Hello! what is MINEPAINT? basically its just microsoft paint but programmed by myself and a friend as its an EPITECH PROJECT called MY_PAINT.


How this programm work.. well.. if you want to choose a color, and then draw? you need to choose the color first and then choose the tool to be able to draw, and when you want to change color.. you need to do this step again.. same if you want to change tool like for the shapes you need to choose the color first then the shapes.

NOTE: Not everything works like the bucket.. of the file management, if you want to upgrade the programm feel free to do so! :)
